        Everyday life in the 21st century is vitally dependant on electricity. <br>
        Without electricity, the world around us would collapse. However, the<br>
        most common and used methods of generating electricity require nonrenewable<br>
        energy sources. They are mostly fossil fuels which include oil, natural gas<br>
        , coal, and much more. Nonrenewable energy sources will eventually be depleted<br>
        if they are continually used at the current scale. Nonrenewable energy sources<br>
        also release harmful byproducts into the atmosphere when burned. Byproducts<br>
        include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, Sulfur dioxide, Nitrogen oxide, lead<br>
        and much more. Some byproducts increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,<br>
        which directly contributes to global warming. Other byproducts can cause ocean<br>
        acidification, poor air quality, and many other negative effects on Earth. Even <br>
        though there are many methods of generating electricity that do not require fossil<br> 
        fuels (renewable energy) many of the methods prove to be inefficient or not always <br>
        able to function. Wind turbines can only reach around 40% efficiency and only during<br>
        high-frequency wind. Most solar panels can only convert 14- 20 % of all the energy<br>
        they harvest <br>
