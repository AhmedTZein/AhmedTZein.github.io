          Solar energy is one of the most common sources of renewable energy. Solar panels are<br> 
          made from subunits called solar cells. The most common solar cells are made of a <br>
          semiconductor called silicon. Silicon and crystals are sandwiched between conducting<br>
          layers. Each silicon atom is connected to its neighbors by 4 strong bonds, disallowing<br>
          movement of electrons. Solar cells have two different layers of silicon,  one has extra<br>
          negatively charged electrons, and the second has extra space for electrons. Where the<br>
          two layers meet is called the PN junction. At the PN junction, electrons wander around<br>
          leaving a positive charge on one layer and a negative charge on the other. When a photon<br>
          with enough energy from the sunlight strikes the solar cell it can knock an electron from <br>
          its bond. The negatively charged electron and positive location of the hole move around. <br>
          The electron moves towards the N side and the hole moves towards the P side. The electric<br>
          field at the PN junction allows the electrons and the holes to move the opposite way from<br>
          each other. This creates a circuit and generates electricity since the electron drawn to<br>
          the side wants to go to the hole on the other side but can only do so by passing through <br>
          conducting wire. The movement of electrons creates electricity.
