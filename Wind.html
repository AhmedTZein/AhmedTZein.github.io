            Wind energy is one of the most common forms of renewable energy. Wind turbines use<br> 
            large blades that are uniquely shaped to be pushed by the air to gyrate and create <br>
            mechanical energy that is used to drive a turbine that converts the mechanical <br>
            energy into electrical energy. Wind turbines are a great way of harnessing wind<br>
            energy because although it requires a lot of energy to be constructed it can make <br>
            the same amount of energy back within 6 months and can still continue operating for<br>
            25 years.<br>
