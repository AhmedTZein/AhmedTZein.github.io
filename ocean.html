          The ocean has an endless supply of kinetic energy. Whether itâ€™s by waves, currents, or tides,<br> 
          there are vast amounts of energy that can be harvested to power the world, but with the right<br>
          technology. The ocean alone absorbs 75% of the solar energy received by the earth and from<br>
          that energy, there are waves, currents, and wind which can all be harnessed and converted into<br>
          usable energy. Other energy sources that can be harnessed from the ocean include tides. Tides,<br>
          the rise and fall of sea levels created by the gravitational effects of the sun, moon, and the<br>
          earth's rotation, were used for their kinetic energy from their change in height and movement<br>
          to gyrate mills in ancient Europe and are now used to generate electricity in many places like<br>
          Britain and Canada's Bay of Fundy. Today tidal energy is harnessed by turbines, which are devices<br>
          that use the water flow to rotate a rotor and then by using a hydroelectric generator the turbine <br>
          is able to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy.<br>

          <li><b>Wave:</b> a long body of water curling into an arched form  </li>
          <li><b>Current:</b> a body of water or air moving in a definite direction,<br>
              especially through a surrounding body of water or air in which <br>
              there is less movement.</li>
